Program Overview and Purpose

The Metaplex DAO Grants Program was created in September/October of 2024 to accelerate adoption of the Metaplex protocol by directly funding builders. The program allocated $100,000 in USDC and 1,000,000 MPLX tokens, split across two focus technologies:


Metaplex Core: A new standard designed to unlock modular, composable NFT development on Solana
 Metaplex 404: A framework enabling NFTs and tokens to be converted interchangeably, opening up new creative and financial use cases.


The program targeted Solana-native developers and teams building across a variety of stages, from applications already in-market, to teams with strong technical track records and promising ideas. The program had a bias toward those building open-source tooling. 

The primary objective was to fund teams whose work would increase protocol-level interactions with Metaplex (i.e., “touches”), since each interaction generates on-chain fee revenue and strengthens the broader ecosystem.

We view the grants program as a key tool to bring more builders into the Metaplex ecosystem, support open-source innovation, and increase DAO participation through both token distribution and technical integration.

Selection and Evaluation Process

Grants were evaluated through a layered vetting and refinement process:

1. Intake: Applications were submitted via Google Form and aggregated into a CRM-style tracker.

2. Initial review: All candidates were discussed during weekly council calls, with comments logged directly in the tracker.

3. Intro call: If any council member expressed interest, a 20-minute introductory call was scheduled to assess the builder’s background, motivations, and proposed Metaplex integration.

4. Technical diligence: Qualified teams were sent a follow-up form requesting technical specifications, funding rationale, and milestone planning.

5. Refinement: Teams collaborated with us and Metaplex Foundation contributors to scope open-source deliverables and align on realistic, milestone-based funding.

6. Agreement and execution: If aligned, we issued an MOU outlining milestones and verification methods. Funding is disbursed upon verified milestone completion.

7. Comms: Upon awarding the grant - a TG group with MPLX marketing and comms is created. 


Misc note - Milestones:  Approximately 85% of grants were milestone-based. The remaining 15% were discretionary upfront payments, reserved for trusted teams with previous grant histories or strong community reputations.

Evaluation criteria focused on:

Potential to drive protocol adoption and usage
Developer credibility and track record
Strategic alignment with Metaplex roadmap
Open-source contributions
Team responsiveness and ability to collaborate

Program Learnings and Challenges

There is a large gap between ideal applications and the submissions received.  

Many proposals arrived in rough form — ambitious product builds, loosely scoped ideas, or requests that didn’t align directly with Metaplex’s mission. However, these raw applications often contained valuable components that could be shaped into high-impact, protocol-aligned deliverables. A $50K app build could become an $8K grant to develop and open-source a new primitive. That reframing process became a core part of our approach.

This required a more involved, collaborative process than simply reviewing proposals at face value. By spending time with applicants and helping them refine their ideas — especially around scope, integration, and open source contribution — we found real opportunity in places that might otherwise be overlooked. This process also led to a deeper relationship between builders and core MPLX dev relations.

IRL engagement continues to be a powerful catalyst. 

Some of the most promising grantee relationships began through face-to-face conversations at ecosystem events. Island DAO — hosted by Dean’s List (now rebranded as “Island DAO”) and attended by both Dean’s List and Metaplex contributors — proved especially effective in surfacing aligned developers and converting interest into applications. These real-world touchpoints remain one of the strongest top-of-funnel drivers, particularly when the grants program has visible presence and representation.

Metaplex mindshare is global. Lots of seeds have been planted

The diversity of where we received applications from is a very positive sign in terms of what it reflects regarding metaplex and its global market share. Notably, in regions where metaplex is much less well established (Japan for example) the application numbers were quite encouraging and speak towards the power of MPLX’s IRL activations.  

The importance of refining program scope and strategy. 

At launch, the grants program was intentionally open-ended — designed to welcome everything from early-stage ideas and solo builders to structured product teams and public goods.  However, the volume and diversity of submissions quickly made it clear that tighter internal alignment was needed. 

The team evolved both its vision of what the program should fund and its process for identifying the most aligned applications. This included clarifying priorities, tightening milestone expectations, and streamlining how technical and strategic fit are assessed. That evolution has made the overall process faster, more consistent, and better calibrated to the DAO’s goals.

MPL 404 adoption surfaced a messaging gap.

While Metaplex Core was widely recognized and drew strong applications, MPL 404 was less familiar — resulting in fewer, more complex submissions that often required hands-on interpretation. The protocol is powerful but less intuitive, and many 404 applications came from dev shops or required technical onboarding. 

This highlighted a need for clearer messaging, better documentation, and more targeted education. Several ambitious 404 grants were funded and are now well-positioned to serve as reference points and catalysts for broader adoption.
